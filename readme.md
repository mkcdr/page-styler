## Customization üé®

If you didn't like the pre-installed CSS libraries then you can add your own to the extension by simply adding your custom CSS file to the `/styles` directory and editing the `styles.js` file to include a new javascript object with a unique `name` to display and the filename as the `path`.

## Reason of Development ‚ùì

While searching for articles to learn coding, I stumbled upon old online articles, they were useful and helped me alot, but the only problem was they had minimal to no styles, plus they did not support "Dark Mode" at all.

So I worked on making this extension to change the appearance of those web pages and make them more comfortable to read.

## Why publishing on GitHub ‚ùó

This extension was intended to be published on `Chrome Web Store`, but I found out that I need to make an account and pay a one time fee of $5! but since I'm poor as F*** and unemployeed programmer (actually I never worked as a programmer), I decided to publish it on `GitHub` hoping that other people could benefit from it.
